# The Burger Builder App

### Builded by Falguni Islam (Self-Taught Software Developer)


* NOTES :


```
   - npx create-react-app the_burger_builder ;
   - npm run eject ;
   - Adding Prop Type Validation :  npm install --save prop-types ;
   - Accessing a Server: Firebase and the Right Databses (Create a Firebase Project) ;
   - Install HTTP/AJAX : npm install --save axios ;
   
   * #ISSUES  :  ERROR : MODULE NOT FOUND (FIXED): 
      -  Run npm install -g npm to update!;
      - (I had delete node_modules directory and package-lock.json file and then i run npm install and after that i run yarn start/npm start and its working now. ) 
      - Alternatively, rm -rf node_modules, then npm install -g npm@latest ; npm install balanced-match ; --- i hope this method will also work. 
      - Because this types of error needs to npm update .

   * Next steps : 
     - I run again after fixing the errors : npm install axios --save ;
     - yarn start is working now in my server ;
     - hoc means higher order component ;

     * Working on Adding Routing :
     * Forms and Form Validation ;
     * Redux ;

#### Planning a React App :
```
    * Component Tree/ Component Structure ;
    * Application State (Data);
    * Components vs Containers ;
     
  * Planning our App Layout and Component Tree ;

  * Adding Routing to my Burger Project :
      - npm install --save react-router-dom react-router ;
      - But we are using npm install --save react-router-dom (in here run it);
      -
